## Project Overview-

Shield Insurance, an insurance provider, operates across five major cities in India: Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Indore. 

They utilize various sales channels to reach their customers, including Offline Agent, Offline Direct, Online App, and Online Websites. The company offers a total of nine different policies. 

My task was to assist Shield Insurance in making data-driven decisions by analyzing their data from November 2022 to April 2023.
